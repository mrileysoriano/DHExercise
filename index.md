## Comments or notes about problems 

This was a great exercise to help brush up on my skills with the various systems and languages we have been working with. In my original HTML/CSS file, I wanted to separate my HTML into one file and create a second, linked CSS file. Although I was able to create the HTML and CSS file, the two did not link. I decided to simply write the CSS information into the HTML file but in future encounters with HTML and CSS I will write in a separate CSS file.
